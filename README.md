# Product List with Cart (Main) - Figma Design

This project is a **Product List with Cart** design, created in **Figma**, which showcases a simple and visually appealing product listing page for an e-commerce site. The design focuses on listing products and providing a shopping cart experience with a clean interface.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Designed product cards showcasing dessert images, titles, descriptions, and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Every product card has an "Add to Cart" button.
- **Interactive Cart**: The cart section updates as items are added, with a placeholder message when it's empty.
- **Responsive Layout**: Design is optimized for desktop but can be adapted for other screen sizes (mobile, tablet, etc.).
- **Clean UI**: Simple, user-friendly design that can be easily customized.
